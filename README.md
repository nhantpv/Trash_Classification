# Trash classification

This project focuses on building **a real-time trash classification** system using Computer Vision and Deep Learning, designed for practical deployment in Vietnam. The system integrates an object detection model (YOLOv5/Resnet) with industrial control hardware (PLC  Siemens S7-1200) to support automated waste sorting.
